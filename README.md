# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
A simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players in the command line. The game features a 3x3 board where players take turns marking cells as 'X' or 'O'. It includes win and draw detection, score tracking, and input validation to prevent overwriting moves. Built using Python's OOP principles, with a clean display that updates after each turn.
